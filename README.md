##  OVERVIEW

The sounds from the speakers and scents of the food mingle in the desert air. Enormous works of art stand tall next to palm trees that sway before the majestic mountains. Blades of grass form a carpet of green where groups of friends come together to forge memories that last forever.

Suja is much more than just a music festival, it is a culture. All things Suja are crafted with ❤️
